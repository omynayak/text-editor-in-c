# Texty

## What is this?
- This here is a text editor designed for UNIX based operating systems, to be run via a Terminal User Interface (TUI)
- Takes heavy inspiration from [Kilo](https://github.com/antirez/kilo), a text editor by antirez.

### This project is currently under development. Any suggestions are welcome.
